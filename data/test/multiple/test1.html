				<h3>Brief Description:</h3> Search engines have become a core part
				of our daily lives. In this course, we will study the foundations of
				information retrieval and the technical aspects of modern Web search
				engines. We will also explore a few advanced topics that have
				emerged to become highly influential in relation to Web search.<br />
			<br /> You are expected to study the course material (textbook and
				research papers), participate in class discussion, and work on a
				class project that involves system design and implementation.

to a group (blind date, how fun!), please email us your NYU Email and CIMS Account User Name.
If we receive enough requests, we will randomly assign you into groups and email each group

the group formation official.</b><br />
